# Breast Cancer Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer. The model is designed to analyze medical data and provide predictions regarding whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant. This README provides an overview of the project, how to use the model, and additional information about the dataset and the model's performance.

## Getting Started

To use this breast cancer prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SHYALI/breast-cancer-prediction.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the prediction script:

python predict.py


4. Follow the prompts to input patient data, and the model will provide a prediction.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). This dataset contains features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies and labels indicating whether the tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M).

## Model Architecture

The breast cancer prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), or a deep learning neural network. The exact architecture and hyperparameters may vary depending on the specific implementation.

## Usage

To use the prediction model, you can call the `predict` function in the `predict.py` script and provide patient data as input. The model will return a prediction indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

## Results

The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are essential for evaluating its reliability. You can find these metrics in the `results.txt` file or in the model's documentation.
